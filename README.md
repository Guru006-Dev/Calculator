# ReactJS Assignment - 5 Separate Questions

This project contains 5 separate React components demonstrating various programming concepts and techniques.

## 📋 Questions Implemented

### Question A: Mathematical Operations
**Location:** `/question-a`

Features:
- **Factorial Calculator**: Calculates n! for any positive integer
- **Fibonacci Series Generator**: Generates the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence
- **Prime Number Checker**: Determines if a number is prime

### Question B: Sum of Digits
**Location:** `/question-b`

Features:
- Read any number and calculate the sum of all its digits
- Visual breakdown showing each digit in the calculation
- Examples provided for reference

### Question C: Question Paper Set Selector
**Location:** `/question-c`

Features:
- Determines which question paper set based on roll number
- Odd roll numbers → Set 1
- Even roll numbers → Set 2
- **Implemented in BOTH Class and Function Component formats**

### Question D: Basic Calculator
**Location:** `/question-d`

Features:
- Standard calculator with full arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
- Modulo operation (%)
- Decimal point support
